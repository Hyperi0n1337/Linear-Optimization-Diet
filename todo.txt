Iodine data is missing. not a big deal, there is a USDA database where they measured iodine amounts for 467 foods, but the ID columns dont match, I could do somesort of index match fuzzy search, but iodine isn't that important. dont have much recommendations other than don't exceed 600 mcg.

The RDAs of some micros are kinda misleading. Let's say calcium's RDA is 1000 mg, but calcium from dairy is absorbed at 80% efficiency, and from spinach it's 20%. Therefore there will be a big difference in absorption between the same amount of calcium but different food choices.
A way to fix this would be to scale the mg of the nutrient of each food group by it's absorption rate, and then use this 'apples to apples' metric. But you would need to determine a new RDA based on this metric, and then actual absorption is affected by other micros and compounds in a food / a meal (ie, vitamin C improves the absorption of iron), so it gets very complicated..

# TODO:
Program carve-outs (like if I want a specific intraworkout drink with specific macros and micros, include it separate as stand-alone, and subtract its info from the rest of the daily diet)
